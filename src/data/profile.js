      abstract: "There are various forms of tourism and each has different impacts to the environment. Tourism is a term used to describe the movement of individuals to areas outside their usual place of residence. It involves the actual activity of travelling and the activities that they indulge in during their stay in the destination. One form of tourism is wildlife tourism. In this case, tourists visit areas where wildlife is in abundance in order to view wild animals in their natural environment. Another form is cultural tourism whereby the tourists mainly visit a destination in order to learn more about different cultures. Religious tourists, on the other hand, are those that that travel for pilgrimage. Ecotourism may be described as Environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas, in order to enjoy, study and appreciate nature and any accompanying cultural features that promote conservation, have a negative visitation impact and provide for substantial beneficial activity.",
